        <p>I started Aston Martin Registry because of Valkyrie. Stories crafted from pure passion are hard to come by, that's what drawed me to the project. The V12 Speedsters, One-77s, and DBS GT Zagatos were all registered in anticipation of that car.</p>
        <br />
        <p>I fell into cars at the early age 3 years old as my parents recall. I don't know why or how, it just happened and cars been my obsession ever since. I fell in love first with classic Ferraris, got the opportunity to judge at Cavallino Classic, attended dozen of events, and it just kept growing from there.</p>
