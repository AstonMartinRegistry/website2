        <p> What are cars? Nested at the intersection of both the sciences and arts, they incorporate almost every discipline known to man, a perfect representation of our ability to create! I'm sure one could model the evolution of human knowledge by following the evolution of cars.</p>
        <br />
        <p> So where does the Valkyrie fit into all of this? The car industry is at an inflection point. This is the first time in 150 years that the primary method of propulasion has shifted, closing the era of combustion engines. When we look back in 500 years on these artifacts of ingenuity, I am confident the Valkyrie will stand out as the best —the best of a century's worth of innovation.</p>
        <br />
        <p> Cars like the Valkyrie should not exist. They go far beyond the intended purpose of a car. However, their existence show a very colourful image of who we are. If we will, we can, and if we can, we push even further. That's the beauty of Valkyrie.</p>
